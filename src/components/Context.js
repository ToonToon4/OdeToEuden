        They say the sun is a star as well,<br />
        But she is my light through the darkest spell.<br />
        When tears fall as I close my eyes,<br />
        Her glow keeps me from where sorrow lies.
      </p>
      <p className="context-paragraph">
        She’s my comfort, my steady guide,<br />
        A warmth I feel when she’s by my side.<br />
        Through her, I’ve seen a world anew,<br />
        If only she knew what her love can do.
      </p>
      <p className="context-paragraph">
        She says she’s fine, though I see her pain,<br />
        I wish I could shield her from the rain.<br />
        Yet lost in my chaos, I failed to see,<br />
        The care she gave so selflessly.
      </p>
      <p className="context-paragraph">
        She taught me love without a price,<br />
        A gift so pure, so rare, so nice.<br />
        Now stars have shifted, our fates entwined,<br />
        My heart is hers, her soul is mine.
      </p>
      <p className="context-paragraph">
        To part from her would be my fall,<br />
        For she is my everything—my all.
